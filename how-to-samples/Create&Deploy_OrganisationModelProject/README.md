Step 2: Drag and Drop Organisation Unit, Position from Palette and create different working units and positions for the Organisation. Also use links to show Hierarchical and Association relationships between the units. Here Association relationship is shown between two different departments i.e. Test and Claim and Hierarchical relationship is showed with Claims sub-departments i.e. Life and Motor.

Step 3: Create Capabilities, Privileges and Groups

Capabilities represent the skills that are available within an organization, for example language skills or possession of a professional qualification. 
Privileges represent the authority that an Organization Unit, Position or Group can have within an organization, such as the authority to approve expenditure up to a defined amount.
