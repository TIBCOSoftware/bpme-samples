## BPM Enterprise provides comprehensive Case Management capabilities and an OOTB Case Manager in the BPME UI. We have listed down some 5.x case management + other project types functionalities along with demos showing the same.

Youtube Playlist is here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnmoGGHHJldiQ8dA8447jwfXZggKfA4Jc and below are all the scenarios/videos covered:

# Part-1: TIBCO BPM Enterprise Data-centric Case Management:

Case Management is relatively new in the evolution of Business Process Management Solutions. With Case management, the focus shifts from long-running process orchestration to a short-lived stateless process that manages the state of a case through the lifecycle that makes up the life of a case. Combining long-running processes with short-lived processes and events processing that drive a case's life enables you to implement very flexible and agile process-based solutions. This video will explore the dynamic nature of TIBCO BPM Enterprise Case Management.

#  Part-2: TIBCO BPM Enterprise Project Structure

This video illustrates a tested structure for a BPM Enterprise Case Management project. This project structure will be the basis of your solution and will allow you to scale the development of an agile BPM solution. Agility means the speed of new and change of existing components of a solution. Re-usability is encouraged through this project assembly, indicating a langer initial development time but faster development in the long run. This structure allows for ease of sharing and versioning the artifacts built through this project.

#  Part-3: TIBCO BPM Enterprise Data Model

The Data Model is the base of the BPM project. Data model attributes and their properties define the user input forms. For this reason, it is essential to use the correct format for attributes. This section will discuss these best practices.

#  Part-4: TIBCO BPM Enterprise Forms Project

Forms are what users interact with within a BPM solution. Forms need to be clear and friendly to assist users in completing their roles in the system. This video shares best practices that promote reuse and ultimately speed up development time.

#  Part-5: TIBCO BPM Enterprise Services Project

Services processes are stateless processes that assist in data manipulation, collection, and external service integration. Services are similar to microservices that will assist in process execution. Doing this right can dramatically speed up the development of BPM projects.

#  Part-6: TIBCO BPM Enterprise Case Actions Project

Case Actions are stateless processes that allow users to perform CRUD services on BPM Case data. Case Actions can be changed and deployed without causing problems with existing running process instances. They are a vital part of the development of an agile BPM solution. This video will talk about some best practices around Case Action creation.

#  Part-7: TIBCO BPM Enterprise Business Services Project

Business Services are special pageflow processes that allow users to capture new case data and perform CRUD services on existing case data. What makes business services different from Case Actions is that they do not start with a reference to an existing case. In the case of updating a current case, they need to be found before you can edit them. Business services can be exposed as a URL for the external system to access or capture new data quickly. We will be discussing these in greater detail in this video.

#  Part-8: TIBCO BPM Enterprise Case Management Process Project

Processes are what drives BPM systems. TIBCO BPM has a powerful engine that provides different types of processes to allow our customers to build flexible and agile solutions. From Human to Human, human to system, system to system, and stateless processes will allow for building any processes-based solution one can imagine. Combine case management and event-based processing with these capabilities, and you have an unparalleled solution in the industry. This video will provide an overview of an advanced implementation of the TIBCO BPM Enterprise that includes these capabilities.

#  Part-9: TIBCO BPM Enterprise REST Services Project

REST services are critical to any BPM Enterprise implementation. BPM processes do not live in isolation. Processes need data from an organization's line of business systems to allow users to make information-based decisions. This video will review the use of REST services in a BPM implementation.
